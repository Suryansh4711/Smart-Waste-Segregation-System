# ♻️ Smart Waste Segregation System  

An AI-powered **smart dustbin** that automatically classifies waste as **biodegradable** or **non-biodegradable** using **Computer Vision (OpenCV)** and **Machine Learning**.  

When a user drops garbage on the bin’s plate, a **webcam** captures the image, processes it in real time using a **GPU-powered laptop (RTX 4060)**, and directs the waste to the correct compartment — making disposal fast, accurate, and hands-free.

## 🌍 Goal  
To build a smarter, more sustainable way of handling waste through automation and AI.  

---

## 🧾 Workflow Overview  
1. Waste is placed on the bin plate.  
2. Webcam captures the image of the waste.  
3. ML model classifies the waste type.  
4. Arduino controls servo motors to open the correct bin compartment.  
5. Data can be logged or monitored for insights.  

---

## 🧩 Future Improvements  
- Add IoT-based cloud monitoring for bin levels.  
- Enhance classification accuracy with more waste datasets.  
- Introduce a recyclable waste category for finer segregation.
